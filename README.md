Assignment to the Machine Learning course at SPBSTU.

# Classification task
It is necessary to create a NN of four layers, setting for all but the last layer a fast calculable activation function RELU. Also create and train (fixing the time taken) at least 3 more neural network models: 
+ with a different number of layers, neurons in them, and activation functions, 
+ with different number of training epochs, 
+ with different optimization method and/or loss function. 

Evaluate the accuracy of predictions produced by neural network models. Record in the report: 
+ hyperparameters of all models, 
+ time spent on training 
+ value of error function and accuracy of predictions. 

# Regression task
Train three versions of the same NS using 3 different processor types (CPU, GPU, and TPU), measuring the time taken to train. Note the time and achieved accuracy of the model in the report. Draw conclusions.

# Classification task (cv): CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 datasets
Need to implement and train a CNN to recognize images from datasets CIFAR-10, 100. In the report indicate the training time and achieved accuracy.
